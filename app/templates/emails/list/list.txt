It's been a long while since I last sent out a blog update! Although I've been silent, I have been covertly working behind the scenes...here are a few notable updates-

- The blog has been completely re-designed and re-built from scratch with a more up-to-date technology stack (from PHP/MySQL/JavaScript to Python/PostgreSQL/TypeScript).

- I've created a settings page for you to be able to update your mailing preferences, such as how often you would like to see emails from me. To not spam you, I have automatically set it so that you will only get emails when I have bigger updates (like this one). To access your settings page, visit {{ url_for('account.settings', _external=True) }}.

- Inspired by buymeacoffee.com (a donation site for creatives), I decided to build my own version to support the cost of running the blog - {{ url_for('main.support', _external=True) }}

In terms of what's next for the blog, I think I'm finally to the point where I'm happy with the blog infrastructure and ready to start actually blogging! Question is...what to blog about? ðŸ˜… I don't have a solid answer to that yet, but I intend explore things over the next couple months and will perhaps give you an update then? :)
