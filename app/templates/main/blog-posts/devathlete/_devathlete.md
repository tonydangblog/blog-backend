At the end of 2019, I decided to [take an indefinite leave from my job as an engineering
project manager]({{ url_for\('main.a_nomadic_experiment'\) }}). The plan was to travel,
gain mental space, and discover the next path to take in life.

After two months of driving across the country and back in my [subie]({{
url_for\('main.subielife'\) }}), the coronavirus pandemic hit, cutting plans for further
travel short.

I hunkered down and, instead of returning to the workforce, decided to live life as if I
were retired, trying to answer the question—*if I had all the time in the world and no
obligations, what would I spend my time doing?*

Six months later, I had the chance to look back and see how I've spent my time during
the past half year.

The answer was clear. There were only two things I did consistently everyday:

1. Learn and write code—specifically web development to build this blog
2. Train physically—specifically calisthenics and handstands

Have I found my path in life? Am I a developer and an athlete?

A **{dev}athlete**?

I still don't know for sure, but this is the path I choose to create for myself right
now...
