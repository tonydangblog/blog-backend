**Update: April 2, 2020—**I started my nomadic, subielife journey before the current <a
target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">pandemic</a>
ensued, but with the state of the world, my journey is now on hold. On the bright side,
I finally got the time to stay put to do some writing and finish this post. I hope you
find the info in this post useful or at least entertaining to read while sheltering at
home. Stay safe everyone! --Tony

## What is subielife?

Have you ever wanted to take off with just a backpack and live anywhere in the world? I
did, but the thought of living with just a single backpack still scares me (for now...).

So instead, I looked for other ways of being able to take off anytime and live anywhere,
but with the comforts of a permanent home. That’s how I stumbled upon the <a
target="_blank" href="https://gnomadhome.com/vanlife-how-to/">#vanlife</a> community.
Vanlife seemed nearly perfect to me, but something was still a little off.  Despite
allowing for freedom of location, vanlife still involved owning and bringing around too
much stuff. In addition, overseas travel can be limited.

That’s when it hit me—why not just downsize vanlife into something even smaller?

Enter **#subielife!**

Subielife is pretty much vanlife in—you guessed it—a Subaru! The difference lies in the
sacrifice of some living conveniences (such as space) for better mobility and less stuff
to carry around. Additionally, since a Subaru is really just a car and not a fully
decked out van build, I feel better about renting housing when I stay anywhere long-term
and would like more space. I can even leave my subie behind for short periods to travel
overseas, just like with backpacking.

## Subielife Setup

In this post, I’ll go over how I have set up “Panda,” my Subaru Outback, for subielife.
With this setup, I have successfully traveled [across the US and back]({{
url_for\('main.a_nomadic_experiment'\) }}) and stayed location independent even after my
road trip.  At the very moment of writing this post, I’m staying put due to the COVID-19
pandemic, but I expect to return to a nomadic subielife once things revert to normal.

Below is my setup as well as some resources if you’re interested in creating something
similar for your own subielife adventures in the future.

*Meet “Panda,” the Subaru Outback.*

Step one of subielife? Get a subie…duh! Panda is a base model 2020 Subaru Outback.
Similar setups can be done for Outbacks of other years, other Subaru vehicles (i.e. the
Crosstrek, Forester, or Ascent), or even non-Subaru vehicles (such as the Toyota
4Runner, but I guess it wouldn’t be subielife anymore then, would it?).

<h3 id="dual-battery">2. Dual Battery</h3>

![Subaru Outback Vanlife with Goal Zero Yeti1400]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/03-subaru-outback-vanlife-goal-zero-yeti-1400-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*The Yeti 1400 Lithium Power Station by Goal Zero.*

When on the road or far away from civilization, it’s nice to have a way to power items
such as cellphones, fans, lights, and even a small fridge. To have this convenience,
I’ve installed a dual battery system in my subie.

A dual battery system consists of hooking up a secondary battery to the subie’s main car
battery, which allows the secondary battery to be charged whenever I am driving. This
secondary battery can then be used to power anything even when the subie is not running.

With such a setup, I practically have infinite electricity as long as I drive a couple
hours each week to keep the secondary battery charged.

I use the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.goalzero.com/shop/archive-power/goal-zero-yeti-1400-lithium-power-station-app/">
Goal Zero Yeti 1400</a> as the dual battery linked with my subie’s main car battery. To
create this setup, the following accessories are needed in addition to the Yeti 1400:

- <a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.goalzero.com/shop/yeti-accessories/yeti-link-expansion-module/">
  Yeti Link Expansion Module</a> – This expansion module is a required add-on to connect
  the Yeti 1400 to the subie’s main car battery and provide isolation so that the Yeti
  1400 doesn’t drain the main battery.
- <a target="_blank"
  href="https://www.goalzero.com/shop/accessories/ec8-12ft-extension-cable/">
  Male EC8 to Ring Terminal Cable and EC8 12Ft Extension Cable</a> – These are the
  cables that need to be routed between the Yeti 1400 and the main battery to connect
  them and allow the Yeti 1400 to be charged.

*CF18 Electric Cooler by Dometic.*

Having a fridge that can run 24/7 in a subie? Sounds pretty extra, right?  You’re right.
It’s probably not necessary to have a fridge, but it is absolutely convenient. From
storing cold drinks, to holding leftovers, to even keeping groceries fresh if I plan on
doing some cooking…this is a small luxury that I do not regret having!

The fridge I use is the <a target="_blank"

<h3 id="bed">4. Bed</h3>

Ah yes...the bed. If I’m going to be living the subielife, having a comfortable bed is
essential. Unfortunately, there aren’t any pre-made bed platforms nor mattresses I could
just purchase and throw into my subie. Fortunately, it wasn’t too hard to DIY my own bed
platform and mattress set.

<h4 id="bed-platform">Bed Platform</h4>

![Subaru Outback Vanlife DIY bed platform]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/10-subaru-outback-vanlife-diy-bed-platform-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*DIY Bed Platform.*

Having a bed platform creates a flat surface for the mattress and also has the added
benefit of extra storage beneath the bed. Below are resources and inspiration I used to
create my own bed platform.

<h4 id="mattress">Mattress</h4>

![Subaru Outback Vanlife DIY bed platform with Zinus memory foam mattress]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/11-subaru-outback-vanlife-diy-bed-platform-zinus-memory-foam-mattress-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*5″ memory foam mattress placed on top of the bed platform.*

Once I had a bed-platform, the next step was to add in a super comfortable mattress!

The mattress I have is the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PZ03ZCU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">
Zinus 5″ Memory Foam Mattress</a>\* (Quick shoutout to <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.parkedinparadise.com/campervan-mattress/">Parked in Paradise</a>,
where I got the mattress recommendation from).

\*Note that this is a full-size mattress (53″ x 72″), which is a little too wide to fit
into a Subaru Outback. The width had to be cut down by 10″ in order to fit into the
subie. This was easily done by removing the mattress cover and cutting the foam
underneath with a kitchen knife. The final mattress dimensions are 43″ x 72″.

![Subaru Outback Vanlife DIY bed platform set-up]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/12-subaru-outback-vanlife-diy-bed-platform-set-up-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*Add in bedding and I now have myself a comfy bed I can take anywhere.*

<h3 id="ventilation">5. Ventilation</h3>

Proper ventilation is crucial if I’m going to spend an extended amount of time in my
subie. Having the windows up when camping in any small vehicle will lead to depletion of
oxygen, build up of carbon monoxide, lots of condensation, and no air circulation. The
solution? Rolling down the windows. &#x1f643;

But wait, what if it rains and what about mosquitoes and other bugs that come around
during the summer? I’m glad you asked…

<h4 id="window-deflectors">Window Deflectors</h4>

![Subaru Outback Vanlife with OEM windowdeflectors]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/13-subaru-outback-vanlife-oem-window-deflectors-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*OEM window deflectors installed on Panda.*

To be able to roll down the windows when it’s raining or snowing, I installed window
deflectors. Subaru makes really sleek and easy-to-install OEM deflectors for Outbacks
and other subies.

OEM deflectors can be purchased online at better prices than at car dealers. I got my
deflectors at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.subaruonlineparts.com/">Subaru Online
Parts</a>.

If you end up ordering and installing OEM window deflectors yourself, they will come
with a set of installation instructions. Check out <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Th9wyAxLY">this video</a> for an example of how
deflectors are installed. Note that actual installation will vary depending on the
subie’s model and year.

![Subaru Outback Vanlife with OEM window deflectors in snow]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/14-subaru-outback-vanlife-oem-window-deflectors-snow-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*With deflectors installed, I can always have the windows cracked open without fear of
any rain or snow getting inside.*

<h4 id="window-vents">Window Vents</h4>

Now, what about those bugs?? The last thing I wanted was to wake up in the morning with
a swarm of mosquitoes in my subie. Luckily, I was able to find a solution in the form of
an obscure part known as car window vents.

Primarily used in the world of car rallying, <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6101Sgbskw&">window vents</a> are a way to allow
for airflow while keeping windows rolled up and not having to use a car’s A/C system.
These parts slide on top of your subie’s windows and have circular holes in them to
allow for airflow. Additionally, the holes can have mesh in them to act as a bug/dust
screen while still allowing airflow.

*Window vents by Billetworkz.*

![Subaru Outback Vanlife with Billetworkz window vents installed]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/16-subaru-outback-vanlife-billetworkz-window-vents-installed-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*Window vents installed on Panda.*

The windows vents I have were made by <a target="_blank"
href="https://billetworkz.com/collections/window-vents">Billetworkz</a> and have foam
mesh in them.

Windows vents are a rather obscure item to find. If you don’t have a shop nearby that
can make them, and can’t find them online for your specific subie, here are a couple
alternative options…

1. Use a one-size-fits-all sunshade like <a target="_blank"
   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YI3IGA6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">
   this</a>.
2. Make DIY window vents. It probably won’t be as clean looking, but it’s better than
   having the creepy crawlers in your subie. Here are some resources:
    - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NQ42gkn2ag">Donovan

<h4 id="fan">Fan</h4>

![Subaru Outback Vanlife O2COOL portable fan]({{
static_file\('img/subielife/17-subaru-outback-vanlife-o2cool-portable-fan-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*Portable Fan by O2COOL.*

The last crucial item for ventilation is having a fan. In many vanlife setups, a rooftop
mounted fan is the way to go. However, that involves cutting a giant hole on top of my
subie…definitely not something I wanted to do. Additionally, I already have a [cargo
box](#cargo-box) up there. So what’s the next best thing? Getting a portable fan to run
inside! Definitely not as efficient as a rooftop fan, but hey—it does the job.

The fan I use is the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014CLAL8S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">
O2COOL 10-Inch Portable Smart Power® Fan</a>.

I found it was best to run the fan off of DC power for lowest power consumption. Since I
already used the 12V DC port on the Yeti 1400 for my fridge, I had to purchase an
additional <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.goalzero.com/shop/sherpa-power-banks-and-accessories/6mm-output-female-cigarette-adapter/">
adapter</a> to be able to run the fan on DC with the Yeti 1400 as well.

<h3 id="cargo-box">6. Cargo Box</h3>

You probably think there isn’t much space while living the subielife. Well, you’re
right. There isn’t much space at all. With the bed taking up most of the back, where do
I keep any extra stuff like essential supplies (toilet paper, jumper cables, etc.),
miscellaneous gear (for hiking, climbing, and other adventures), or even extra clothes?
The answer—in a roof-mounted cargo box!

![Subaru Outback Vanlife with Yakima Skybox 16 cargo-box]({{

*Crush Light by Goal Zero.*

When the sun goes down, the stars come out, and although they are beautiful, they aren’t
bright enough to light up my subie at night. This is where having additional lighting,
such as a solar lantern, is useful if I need to find something in the dark.

The lantern I use is the <a target="_blank"

static_file\('img/subielife/21-subaru-outback-vanlife-waterbrick-water-tank-1280px.jpg'\) }})
*3.5 Gallon Water Tank by WaterBrick.*

Having a supply of water is crucial for any long road trip. However, since I did not
plan to be far away from civilization for the most part, I decided on a smaller tank to
save on space.

The water tank I use is a <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053GVRWQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">

spigot</a> for easy dispensing.

**Note on safety**: I keep this tank in the back of my subie on top of the mattress. One
thing to keep in mind is that anything on top of the mattress can come flying up towards
the windshield if not secured when suddenly braking. Thus, for safety, the tank is
secured with a <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MW7BB7C?pf_rd_r=TAG2MVEBEFEK3ZFVP4WA&pf_rd_p=ab873d20-a0ca-439b-ac45-cd78f07a84d8">

<h3 id="privacy">9. Privacy</h3>

When living the subielife in more remote areas, it can be quite the magical view looking
out the windows and sleeping under the stars...but what happens if I find myself in a
city and decide to stay there for a night? It would definitely not be magical to wake up
with a stranger looking in from outside.  &#x1f631;&#x1f631;

Thankfully, there are a couple options to increase privacy...

<h4 id="window-tint">Window Tint</h4>

The first thing for additional privacy is adding window tint.

If you happen to be in the SF Bay Area and need window tinting, I recommend this <a
target="_blank" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/best-image-san-mateo">shop</a> in San
Mateo, CA. Ask for their <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.johnsonwindowfilms.com/automotive-products/insulatir/">ceramic tint</a>
for better thermal performance.

<h4 id="window-covers">Window Covers</h4>

But even with window tint, there is not true privacy since light can still pass through.
For true privacy, I needed to make myself a DIY set of window covers...

<h3 id="cooking">10. Cooking</h3>

I’ll be honest, although I originally did have a cooking setup in my subie, I’ve only
ever used it once. Eating out with friends and exploring the local cuisine is much more
fun and less of a hassle than cooking on the road.

But what about when I’m not in a city and have no access to restaurants? Well, it turns
out having food in the fridge along with a stock of non-perishable foods has been more
than enough for me, even if I were in the wilderness for a week. Thus, after about 3
months of subielife, I have decided to remove the cooking setup from my subie
completely.

<h3 id="other-miscellaneous-items">11. Other Miscellaneous Items</h3>

The above sections cover the major items in my subielife setup, but there are a few
miscellaneous items I have also brought along for convenience and safety. Below is a
list of some items I’ve found useful to have.
