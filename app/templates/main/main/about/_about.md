<h1 class="h--center">Hi there, I’m Tony.</h1>

I created this blog with the assumption that visitors will mostly be friends and
acquaintances, but for everyone I’ve not yet met, here’s a quick summary—

## Me in 5 bullet points...

- Born and raised in the SF Bay Area. Attended college in SoCal at the <a
  target="_blank" href="https://uci.edu">University of California, Irvine</a>.
- Professionally a mechanical engineer and engineering project manager, but currently on
  an [indefinite sabbatical]({{ url_for\('main.a_nomadic_experiment'\) }}).
- Unprofessionally a fledgling-coder and fitness-enthusiast. Or, as I like to call it, a
  [{dev}athlete]({{ url_for\('main.devathlete'\) }}).
- When I’m not writing code nor training at the gym, I’m most likely meditating,
  listening to podcasts, or journaling.
- <a target="_blank" href="http://typelogic.com/intj.html">INTJ</a>, minimalist,
  learner, unconventional thinker, spontaneous yet strategic.
