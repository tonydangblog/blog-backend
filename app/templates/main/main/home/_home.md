I am a self-taught developer and calisthenics enthusiast. This blog is a space for me to
experiment with my current tech stack of choice (<a target="_blank"
href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a>, <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>), as well as write about and share
my creations and learnings.

For more about me, check out my [about]({{ url_for\('main.about'\) }}) and [now]({{
url_for\('main.now'\) }}) pages. For my all my posts, head on over to the [posts](
{{ url_for\('main.posts'\) }}) page.
